# Give-me-some-credit-kaggle
This is a notebook code with explanation about a kaggle competition on risk of default on credits of banks.

In this model I have used XGBoost Classifier which is a great model for dealing with imbalanced datasets (like this dataset) and running it through different random seed on the validation set, helped the model to learn more generalizable information from the training set and be able to work as good on a new test set.

There exist a lot more ideas to run on this dataset and a lot of visualization techniques to understand the underlying patterns in the data, and given the time constraint of this challenge the most important aspects of a good modeling approach was implemented in this work.

In order to run the code and see the performance, please open the competition page and go to the Kernels tab and open a new kernel. From there, upload the given notebook file in this repository on the kaggle platform. Commit the code, and wait for it to run completely. After that, click on the "Open Version" tab. After openning the version, scroll down to the end and click on "submit to the competition". The you can see the score of your model on top right of the screen.
